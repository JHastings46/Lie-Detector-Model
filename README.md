# Lie Detector Data Analysis Project

## Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of data related to lie detection. The project is divided into several key components, each focusing on different stages of data processing and analysis, including sampling, data wrangling, exploratory data analysis (EDA), regression analysis, and machine learning.

## Project Structure
- **1.Start Sampleling Data copy.R**: Initial data sampling script in R.
- **2.Lie Detector- Data Wrangling(1).ipynb**: Jupyter notebook for data cleaning and preparation.
- **3.Lie Detector Exploratory Data analysis (1).ipynb**: Jupyter notebook for exploratory data analysis (EDA).
- **4.Lie Detector Regression analysis.ipynb**: Jupyter notebook for regression analysis.
- **5.Lie Detector Machine learning.ipynb**: Jupyter notebook for machine learning modeling.

## Installation
To run the notebooks in this repository, you will need to have the following software installed:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- R (for the initial sampling script)
- Relevant Python libraries (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, etc.)

## Usage
1. **Start Sampling Data**:
   - Open `1.Start Sampleling Data copy.R` in RStudio or another R environment.
   - Run the script to perform initial data sampling.

2. **Data Wrangling**:
   - Open `2.Lie Detector- Data Wrangling(1).ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
   - Execute the cells to clean and prepare the dataset for analysis.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Open `3.Lie Detector Exploratory Data analysis (1).ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
   - Execute the cells to perform EDA and visualize data insights.

4. **Regression Analysis**:
   - Open `4.Lie Detector Regression analysis.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
   - Execute the cells to build and evaluate regression models.

5. **Machine Learning**:
   - Open `5.Lie Detector Machine learning.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
   - Execute the cells to build and evaluate machine learning models.

## Files
- **1.Start Sampleling Data copy.R**: Script for initial data sampling in R.
- **2.Lie Detector- Data Wrangling(1).ipynb**: Notebook for data cleaning and preparation.
- **3.Lie Detector Exploratory Data analysis (1).ipynb**: Notebook for exploratory data analysis.
